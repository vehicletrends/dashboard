This dashboard analyzes over **10 million vehicle listings** from 2018 to 2024, providing insights into how different powertrain types—gasoline, hybrid, and electric vehicles—are used, valued, and compete in the American automotive market.

Data from the [vehicletrends](https://github.com/jhelvy/vehicletrends) open-source project (Dr. John Paul Helveston, George Washington University) using MarketCheck automotive listing data covering all 50 US states.

## Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)

The [Daily VMT](daily-vmt.qmd) page shows the distribution of daily VMT across all vehicles in the dataset. Each chart displays quantiles of daily mileage for a given combination of powertrain and vehicle type. For example, the 0.5 quantile represents the median daily mileage (half of vehicles drive less than this amount and half drive more). 

The [VMT by Age](age-vmt.qmd) page shows median cumulative vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by vehicle age. Each chart displays the 50th quantile (median) of total mileage for a given combination of powertrain and vehicle type as vehicles age over time. 

For both of the VMT pages, we estimate mileage by computing quantiles of the odometer readings of vehicles listed in the used market. For the Daily VMT, we use all vehicles (regardless of age) and compute a detailed accounting of VMT for every quantile from 1 to 99. For VMT by age, we estimate the age of the vehicle as the listing date minus the production date, which we estimate as June 30 of the year previous to the model year (e.g., we estimate a 2020 model year vehicle was produced June 30, 2019).

## Depreciation

Examines how vehicles retain value over time across different powertrains. Shows the percentage of original price (MSRP) retained at each vehicle age, revealing which powertrains hold their value best and how quickly vehicles depreciate in their first 5 years.

## Market Concentration

Tracks market share and competitive dynamics across manufacturers within each powertrain category. Measures how concentrated or competitive each segment is, showing whether markets are dominated by a few manufacturers or have healthy competition across many brands.

## Listings

Detailed analysis of vehicle listings data, including pricing trends, availability, and inventory levels across different segments. Shows current market inventory patterns and pricing across vehicle types and powertrains.

## Dealerships Inventories

Explores dealership inventory patterns, stock levels, and geographic distribution of vehicle availability. Shows how dealer inventory is distributed across regions and vehicle types.
