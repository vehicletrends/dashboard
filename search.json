    "text": "Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)\nThe Daily VMT page shows the distribution of daily VMT across all vehicles in the dataset. Each chart displays quantiles of daily mileage for a given combination of powertrain and vehicle type. For example, the 0.5 quantile represents the median daily mileage (half of vehicles drive less than this amount and half drive more).\nThe VMT by Age page shows median cumulative vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by vehicle age. Each chart displays the 50th quantile (median) of total mileage for a given combination of powertrain and vehicle type as vehicles age over time.\nFor both of the VMT pages, we estimate VMT by dividing the odometer readings (mileage) of used vehicles by their age, which gives an approximation of the VMT over time. We estimate the age of the vehicle as the listing date minus the production date, which we estimate as June 30 of the year previous to the model year (e.g., we estimate a 2020 model year vehicle was produced June 30, 2019). We summarize this quantity by taking quantiles of the observations. For daily VMT, we use all vehicles regardless of age and compute the VMT for every quantile from 1 to 99. For VMT by age, we only include the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantile.",
