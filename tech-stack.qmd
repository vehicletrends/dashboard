This page describes the technologies used to build and deploy the US Vehicle Trends dashboard.

## Site Framework

The dashboard is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. Quarto renders the `.qmd` (Quarto Markdown) source files into the static HTML pages that make up this website.

## Data Processing

All data processing and analysis is done in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Key R packages used on the site include:

| Package | Purpose |
|:--------|:--------|
| [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) | Data manipulation and transformation |
| [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) | Interactive data tables |
| [htmltools](https://rstudio.github.io/htmltools/) | HTML generation for embedded content |
| [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) | Enhanced table formatting |
| [pmtiles](https://walker-data.com/pmtiles/) | Generation of PMTiles tiled map data for the HHI map |
| [vehicletrends](https://pkg.vehicletrends.us/) | Summary data package for this project |

## Interactive Charts

Most of the interactive chart visualizations are built with [echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/), an R interface to [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/).

The interactive map on the [Market Concentration](market-concentration.qmd#map) page is built with [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/), an open-source map rendering library. The underlying census tract geometries and HHI data are served as [PMTiles](https://protomaps.com/docs/pmtiles), a cloud-optimized format for tiled map data. The PMTiles archive is generated in R using the [{pmtiles}](https://walker-data.com/pmtiles/) package (which wraps [Tippecanoe](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe)) and hosted on [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) for low-latency delivery. The base map tiles are provided by [CARTO](https://carto.com/).

The [HHI Explained](hhi-explained.qmd) page features an interactive Shiny application that runs entirely in the browser using [Shinylive](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/), which compiles R and Shiny to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) via [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/). This means the app requires no server — all computation happens client-side.

## Hosting and Deployment

The site is rendered automatically via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) on every push to the main branch and on a weekly scheduled build. The rendered site is deployed to and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
