Each chart displays quantiles of daily mileage for a given combination of powertrain and vehicle type. For example, the 0.5 quantile represents the median daily mileage (half of vehicles drive less than this amount and half drive more).\nThe VMT by Age page shows median cumulative vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by vehicle age. Each chart displays the 50th quantile (median) of total mileage for a given combination of powertrain and vehicle type as vehicles age over time.\nFor both of the VMT pages, we estimate mileage by computing quantiles of the odometer readings of vehicles listed in the used market. For the Daily VMT, we use all vehicles (regardless of age) and compute a detailed accounting of VMT for every quantile from 1 to 99. For VMT by age, we estimate the age of the vehicle as the listing date minus the production date, which we estimate as June 30 of the year previous to the model year (e.g., we estimate a 2020 model year vehicle was produced June 30, 2019).",
