## Data

This is an interactive analysis tool that computes vehicle similarity based on selected parameters. The data is generated dynamically based on your search criteria in the Charts tab above.

**How it works:**
- Select target vehicle characteristics (make, type, price range)
- The app identifies similar vehicles based on multiple attributes
- View results as scatter plots or data tables
- Adjust the number of similar vehicles to display
